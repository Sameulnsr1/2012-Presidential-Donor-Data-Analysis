# 2012-Presidential-Donor-Data-Analysis

The questions I attempted to answer while looking at this Data Set are:
  
  1. How much was donated and what was the average donation?
  2. How did the donations differ between candidates?
  3. How did the donations differ between Democrats and Republicans?
  4. What were the demographics of the donors?
  5. Is there a pattern to donation amounts?
